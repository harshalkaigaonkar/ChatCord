# Contribute to Cords
**Cords welcomes contributions from the open-source community!**
## please keep the following values in mind while making your meaningful contributions->
### 1. Everyone is Welcome 
      * Participants in Hacktoberfest come from all over the world and represent thousands of unique skill sets. This program welcomes everyone who's already part of the open source software community, and anyone who is interested in “diving in”.
### 2. Quantity is fun, quality is key
      * Participating in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth, professional opportunities, and community building. However, it all begins with meaningful contributions to open source software. We are committed to prioritizing quality contributions as outlined in our participation rules.
### 3. Short-term action , long-term impact
      * In the open source software community, we are standing on the shoulders of project maintainers and those who came before us. Your participation has a lasting effect on people and technology long after October.
      
Low quality contributions are discouraged and may be marked as spam by maintainers. examples of low quality contributions are as follows->
* Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.
* Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.
* Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
* Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.
* Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.


















# Contribute to ScottPlot

**ScottPlot welcomes contributions from the open-source community!** Bug reports, questions, and feature suggestions are welcome as [issues](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot/discussions/categories/q-a).

## Pull Requests

**Consider creating an issue to discuss your pull request _before_ investing a lot of work into it.** This is an opportunity to ensure your modifications (and their timing) will be consistent with the direction ScottPlot is going, also a good chance to get feedback and suggestions that may improve your implementation.

**If your code is not auto-formatted, the build will fail** when you create your pull request. Use [autoformat.bat](src/autoformat.bat) or run these commands to autoformat the entire code base:

```sh
dotnet tool update -g dotnet-format
dotnet format
```
